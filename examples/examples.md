## Example 1
### Instructions:
Use the entities and relationships to rewrite the following key sentences to generate independent sentence which don't contains conjunction words for each relationship, the sentence must contain the related entity full name, entity abbreviation and relationship type:

This is an example:
-----------------------
Entities: Short-chain fatty acids (Metabolite), G-protein-coupled receptor (Pathway)
Relationships: Metabolite --[activated_by]-- Pathway
Key Sentences: SCFAs are the primary metabolites of gut bacteria, which are derived from the fermentation of dietary fibers. They activate GPCR signaling, suppress histone HDAC activity, and inhibit inflammation, facilitating the maintenance of gut health and biofunction.
Answer:
Metabolite --[activated_by]-- Pathway:
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are primary metabolites produced by gut bacteria from dietary fibers. These SCFAs activate the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway.
-----------------------

### Question:
Entities: ω-3 PUFAs (Metabolite), PM2.5 (Chemical), Lung Injure (Disease)
Relationships: Disease --[induced_by] -- Chemical, Disease --[alleviated_by]-- Metabolite
Key Sentences: ω-3 PUFAs ameliorate lung histopathological injury, reduce inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, affect lung metabolite profile, and modulate gut microbiota in PM2.5-induced lung injury mice.

### Answer:
Disease --[induced_by]-- Chemical:
Mice exposed to PM2.5 exhibit PM2.5-induced lung injury.↳

Disease --[alleviated_by]-- Metabolite:
ω-3 PUFAs alleviate PM2.5-induced lung injury in mice by reducing inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, affecting lung metabolite profile, and modulating gut microbiota.

### Question:
Entities: Azithromycin (Chemical), Streptococcus (Microbe), Streptococcus (Microbe), Neisseria (Microbe), 
Relationships: Microbe --[reduced_by] -- Chemical, Microbe --[increased_by] -- Chemical
Key Sentences: Azithromycin exposure resulted in a decrease in the detection rate and relative abundance of different genera belonging to Veillonellaceae, Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, and Haemophilus. In contrast, the relative abundance of taxa belonging to Streptococcus increased immediately after azithromycin intervention. 

### Answer:
Microbe --[reduced_by]-- Chemical: Azithromycine intervention reduces the detection rate and relative abundance of different genera belonging to Veillonellaceae, Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, and Haemophilus.
Microbe --[increased_by]-- Chemical: Azithromycine intervention increases the relative abundance of taxa belonging to Streptococcus immediately after exposure.
