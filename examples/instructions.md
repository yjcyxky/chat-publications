### How to extract relationships from text by using ChatGPT

```markdown
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction: Please output all relationships which can match the following relationship type: disease_name[Disease] - associated_with - microbe_name[Microbe]; gene_name[Gene] - associated_with - chemical_name[Chemical]; gene_name[Gene] - associated_with - disease_name[Disease];
### Input: chronic exposure to air pollutants appears deleterious on lung function levels in LT recipients (LTRs), might be modified by macrolides, and increases mortality. Our findings established a link between the lung microbial ecosystem, human lung function, and clinical stability post-transplant. a decreased expression of CLEC1A in human lung transplants is predictive of the development of chronic rejection and associated with a higher level of interleukin 17A; Immune cells support airway remodeling through the production of plasma MMP-9 levels, a potential predictive biomarker of CLAD. Blood CD9-expressing B cells appear to favor the maintenance of long-term stable graft function and are a potential new predictive biomarker of BOS-free survival. An early increase of blood CD4 + CD57 + ILT2+ T cells after LT may be associated with CLAD onset.

### How to extract entities from text by using ChatGPT

```markdown
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction: Please output all entities and related entity types which must defined in the following list: disease; microbe; gene; drug;
### Input: Air pollution from livestock farms is known to affect respiratory health of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanisms behind this relationship, however, remain poorly understood. We hypothesise that air pollutants could influence respiratory health through modulation of the airway microbiome. Therefore, we studied associations between air pollution exposure and the oropharyngeal microbiota (OPM) composition of COPD patients and controls in a livestock-dense area. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 99 community-based (mostly mild) COPD cases and 184 controls (baseline), and after 6 and 12 weeks.

### How to rewrite key sentences by using ChatGPT

```markdown
### Instruction:
Use the entities and relationships to rewrite the following key sentences to generate independent sentence which don't contains conjunction words for each relationship, the sentence must contain the related entity full name, entity abbreviation and relationship type:
Entities: Short-chain fatty acids (Metabolite), G-protein-coupled receptor (Pathway), deacetylase (Protein)
Relationships: G-protein-coupled receptor --[activated_by]-- Short-chain fatty acids, deacetylase --[inhibited_by]-- Short-chain fatty acids
Key Sentences: SCFAs are the primary metabolites of gut bacteria, which are derived from the fermentation of dietary fibers. They activate GPCR signaling, suppress histone HDAC activity, and inhibit inflammation, facilitating the maintenance of gut health and biofunction. The aforementioned gut microbiota dysbiosis reduces SCFA levels. Treatment targeting SCFA/GPCR signaling may alleviate air pollution-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders, which involve lung-gut axis disruption.

### Answer:
1. For the relationship "G-protein-coupled receptor --[activated_by]-- Short-chain fatty acids":
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are primary metabolites produced by gut bacteria from dietary fibers. These SCFAs activate the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. This activation process is vital for maintaining gut health and overall biological function.

2. For the relationship "deacetylase --[inhibited_by]-- Short-chain fatty acids":
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) also have an effect on certain proteins, specifically deacetylases. SCFAs inhibit the activity of these deacetylases. This inhibition helps to manage inflammation within the gut, promoting overall health and wellbeing.

### How to rewrite key sentences by using Vicuna

Based on the examples which are listed in examples.md, we know the vicuna is easier to be affected by the irrelevant information. So we need to filter the irrelevant information before we use the vicuna to rewrite the key sentences.

### Instruction:
Use the entities and relationships to rewrite the following key sentences to generate independent sentence which don't contains conjunction words for each relationship, the sentence must contain the related entity full name, entity abbreviation and relationship type:

This is an example:
-----------------------
Entities: Short-chain fatty acids (Metabolite), G-protein-coupled receptor (Pathway)
Relationships: Metabolite --[activated_by]-- Pathway
Key Sentences: SCFAs are the primary metabolites of gut bacteria, which are derived from the fermentation of dietary fibers. They activate GPCR signaling, suppress histone HDAC activity, and inhibit inflammation, facilitating the maintenance of gut health and biofunction.
Answer:
Metabolite --[activated_by]-- Pathway:
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are primary metabolites produced by gut bacteria from dietary fibers. These SCFAs activate the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway.
