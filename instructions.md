### How to extract relationships from text by using ChatGPT

```markdown
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction: Please output all relationships which can match the following relationship type: disease_name[Disease] - associated_with - microbe_name[Microbe]; gene_name[Gene] - associated_with - chemical_name[Chemical]; gene_name[Gene] - associated_with - disease_name[Disease];
### Input: chronic exposure to air pollutants appears deleterious on lung function levels in LT recipients (LTRs), might be modified by macrolides, and increases mortality. Our findings established a link between the lung microbial ecosystem, human lung function, and clinical stability post-transplant. a decreased expression of CLEC1A in human lung transplants is predictive of the development of chronic rejection and associated with a higher level of interleukin 17A; Immune cells support airway remodeling through the production of plasma MMP-9 levels, a potential predictive biomarker of CLAD. Blood CD9-expressing B cells appear to favor the maintenance of long-term stable graft function and are a potential new predictive biomarker of BOS-free survival. An early increase of blood CD4 + CD57 + ILT2+ T cells after LT may be associated with CLAD onset.

### How to extract entities from text by using ChatGPT

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
### Instruction: Please output all entities and related entity types which must defined in the following list: disease; microbe; gene; drug;
### Input: Air pollution from livestock farms is known to affect respiratory health of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mechanisms behind this relationship, however, remain poorly understood. We hypothesise that air pollutants could influence respiratory health through modulation of the airway microbiome. Therefore, we studied associations between air pollution exposure and the oropharyngeal microbiota (OPM) composition of COPD patients and controls in a livestock-dense area. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 99 community-based (mostly mild) COPD cases and 184 controls (baseline), and after 6 and 12 weeks.
